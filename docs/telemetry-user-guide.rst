Telemetry User Guide
====================

Overview
--------

Traditional way to get running information from network device, such as snmp or netflow,
is becoming insufficient in sdn network. Because sdn application needs better performance
and more flexible data format. Itâ€˜s necessary to implement a telemetry channel to support
new app in sdn( (e.g. traffic optimization).
